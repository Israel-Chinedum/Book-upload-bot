The essay traces Robespierre’s evolution from a provincial lawyer inspired by Rousseau’s ideals of virtue and equality to the uncompromising revolutionary who endorsed mass executions for the sake of preserving the Republic. Morley highlights the paradox in Robespierre’s character: incorruptible in personal life, yet fanatical in public policy. He does not excuse Robespierre’s role in the bloodshed but situates him within the turmoil of the French Revolution, where ideals often collapsed into violence. For Morley, Robespierre is both a warning and a lesson about the dangers of absolute conviction when untempered by humanity.","year":"","type":"FREE","price":0,"ISBN":"","status":"ACTIVE","genre":"History","index":30},{"book_title":"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 2 of 3), Essay 2_ Turgot","author":"John Morley","description":"In this essay, Morley analyzes the life of Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727–1781), a French statesman, economist, and philosopher who embodied the rational optimism of the Enlightenment.

He reviews Condorcet’s Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, in which Condorcet envisioned the steady, inevitable progress of reason, science, and human freedom. Morley portrays Condorcet as a symbol of rationalist faith and democratic idealism, but also as a tragic figure destroyed by the Revolution he supported. Condorcet’s end—dying in prison while fleeing Robespierre’s government—underscored the failure of Enlightenment optimism in the face of revolutionary terror.

Setting his gaze two years after the main hostilities (between August and November 1920), Graham observes how the war has shaped the land, the people, and especially the experiences of the ordinary soldier.\nAs he travels through France, he examines graveyards, war memorials, ruined villages, and the paths of those men who fought. He gives voice to their memories, grief, and sometimes their absence. This is not a battle narrative so much as it is a meditation on the cost of war, the haunting presence of the dead, and the struggle of survivors to find meaning in landscapes scarred by conflict. Scenes vary from the serene to the horrifying — from peaceful, undisturbed towns to places where the natural and manmade environments still bear marks of destruction.\nGraham’s style is vivid and lyrical. He juxtaposes moments of beauty and everyday life (trams, empty market squares, churches, nature) with the lingering presence of death (graves, memorials, lost comrades). The book invites the reader to imagine how the war changed what was considered normal, how the memory of the fallen was kept alive, and how returning soldiers and civilians tried to reweave their lives from the ruins.","year":"","type":"FREE","price":0,"ISBN":"","status":"ACTIVE","genre":"Fiction","index":686}],[{"book_title":"Challenge of the North","author":"James B.
