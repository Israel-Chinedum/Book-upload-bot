    "description": "\"Cornish Saints & Sinners\" by J. Henry Harris is a collection of stories rooted in the folklore and history of Cornwall, written in the early 20th century. The book unfolds through a narrative that blends elements of travelogue, humor, and local legends as it chronicles the adventures of characters exploring the enchanting landscapes of Cornwall, leading to encounters with famous saints and the mischievous piskies. The story focuses on a trio of friends—Guy Moore, George Milner (the \"Bookworm\"), and the narrator—who embark on a journey filled with local lore, picturesque scenery, and lively dialogues. The beginning of the work introduces us to these three friends as they set out for Penzance during a splendid August day. Their initial banter reveals their personalities: Guy is adventurous and carefree, while the Bookworm is scholarly and somewhat anxious about leaving behind his books. As they travel westward, they become enchanted by the sights and sounds of the countryside, reflecting on their plans to explore the region without a guidebook. Through humorous encounters with locals and discussions about Cornwall's unique history, including stories of saints and smugglers, the opening establishes a vibrant setting that immerses readers into the rich tapestry of Cornish culture and lore.",
